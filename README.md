# Project: Consolation

A work-in-progress project aimed at extending and improving upon the PC port of [007: Quantum of Solace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/007:_Quantum_of_Solace), a game that runs on the Call of Duty engine between <i>Call of Duty: 4</i> & <i>Call of Duty: World at War.</i>

## Fun facts

- QoS is abandonware!
- QoS was drastically different on the Wii version and even recieved updates
- QoS seems to be <i><b>very</i></b> similar to the IW3 engine, even though it was developed by [a small team at] Treyarch during <i>World at War</i>
- the game had a very messy development process, and their deadline was 9 months (source: [Treyarch's 007 Quantum of Solace tie-in game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bU4FkHVYYdU))
- the developers had to improvise 70% of the plot of the Singleplayer based off their own research into 007
- we could call this "T3", but it's not really a COD game so it wouldn't make much sense and is just a standalone Treyarch title between IW3 & T4
